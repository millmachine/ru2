## Basics of ORP | Yokogawa Electric Corporation
ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential) is the measurement, in millivolts, of a solution's capacity for electron transfer (oxidation or reduction). ORP measurement may also be called REDOX for REDuction OXidation. The name reflects that fact that within a chemical reaction reduction and oxidation are complementary; one cannot occur without the other.

Copper. Copper (Cu) is an extremely useful industrial metal that is ductile (capable of being drawn into wire), malleable (capable of being hammered and molded) and an excellent conductor of electricity (only silver is better). Copper is found in many minerals that occur in deposits large enough to mine.
